HTML is a library which provides tools for parsing and printing of HTML5 documents and fragments. Unlike PHP's DOM and other similar libraries the goal of the project is to parse HTML as accurate to the specification as possible given the limitations of PHP's DOM and of the uses of the library. Therefore, there is no scripting in this implementation, and there likely never will be.
