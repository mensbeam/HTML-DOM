We try to make the installation of the MensBeam HTML library as easy and straightforward as possible.

## Requirements ##

HTML intentionally has few requirements. It only requires PHP 7.1.0 or later with the [dom](http://php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php) extension installed. It is recommended to install the [ctype](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ctype.php) extension for performance improvements, but it is not required.

TODO: Add Installation instructions once there are releases and a package is available on Packagist.
