Document::C14NFile â€” **DISABLED**

## Description ##

```php
public Document::C14NFile ( string $uri , bool $exclusive = false , bool $withComments = false , array|null $xpath = null , array|null $nsPrefixes = null ) : false
```

This function has been disabled and will always return `false`. `\DOMDocument::C14NFile` is an extremely slow and inefficient method to serialize DOM and never should be used. Documented to show difference from [`\DOMDocument`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domdocument.php).
